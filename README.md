# About me
I am a self-taught junior full-stack web developer from El Salvador. My passion lies in learning with each new step and designing solutions for problems in my environment.

I am currently studying Computer Engineering at José Simeón Cañas Central American University (UCA in spanish) in El Salvador. I have applied my knowledge at CONIA Web Services, the presentations and conferences platform used by UCA for graduate students and professors to present their research. My role includes supervising visual content and performing unit and end-to-end testing on different service modules.

I am expanding my skills in API security, integration of protocols such as OAuth, and secure and versatile web application deployment.
